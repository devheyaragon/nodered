# Forward ASR and SAY output

This flow demonstrates how to capture all output from the ASR and spoken messages, and to forward them to an HTTP endpoint.

The use case involves the 'E-haus' environment, where 'Aragon' responds to user AI queries such as "I have a headache this morning, what can I do?" The spoken responses are broadcast through a speaker. Simultaneously, both the user's query and Aragon's response are transmitted to a display.
